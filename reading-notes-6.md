# Reading notes 6

Roy felding helped to create the first web servers and did a lot of research explaining why the web works the way it does. 

The way it works now isn't as good because you need to talk to a bunch of machines and it was not designed with that in mind.

Http allows browsers to "GET" which allows them to get all the resources needed to display the webpage. It is important for getting all sorts of things like videos and what nots.

POST allows a system to add something to another system.

PUT is used to replace something in another system.

PATCH is used to do a partial update. 

So in other words the http allows the browser to use the above verbs.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know how web pages can load only a section of a page at a time and the rest of the page does not load. Like if you click on a certain thing and it will update only that section of the webpage.

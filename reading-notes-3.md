## Map()

Map allows you to auto return and go through each item in an array and assign it to a new array that is set before calling it.

You can even render each array item into a list by putting a list tag beneth it and the variable of the array between.

Using Map allows you to assign a key value to list items to prevent an error.

>Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## Spread

The Spread operator denoted by ```...``` allows you to pass an array as arguments. You can even copy an array if needed. Possibly more useful is the ability to concatenate two different arrays by passing them both as arguments with the spread operator before them.

# Reading notes 4

## Controlled Components

>In HTML, form elements such as ```<input>```, ```<textarea>```, and ```<select>``` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

>We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

When using the user responses with controlled components you can automatically update the responses as they are typed. 

We can target user input with ```<textarea>```.

## Things I want to know more about

I really want to learn more about how components work in react I am very interested.
